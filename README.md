Mura X-Ray Segmentation Project

This project is an implementation of the Segnet Image Segmenetation CNN for use on the Stanford Mura Dataset. The model is trained to segment between the body and not body parts of an X-Ray image. The project uses Keras and Tensorflow for ML and uses PyQt for a training feedback GUI. I can't include the dataset and segmentations in this github respository (due to both size and licenscing constraints), but here's a few examples of what the dataset does:
